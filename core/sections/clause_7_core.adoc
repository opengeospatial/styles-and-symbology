== Requirements Class "Core"

=== Overview
The requirements described in this section define the symbology core requirement class. The following UML diagram (<<img-uml-class-core>>) shows the fundamental concepts of the Symbology Conceptual and Logical Model:

/'Note: zOrder needs discussion on whether it should be relative or float
and how to relate to encodings where the visual priority order
comes from the order of the rules.'/
....

==== Styles

A Style is the root concept of the Styles and Symbology Conceptual Model and consists of an ordered list of StylingRules.
The StylingRules are to be applied in order so that rules selected later override earlier ones.
This allows to compose styles in a cascading manner by inheriting from a base style then overriding some specific portrayal behaviors.

////
This class organizes the rules of symbolizing instructions to be applied by a rendering engine on a layer of geographic features
(e.g., vector based spatial data or raster data).

Please note that the graphic pipeline of the rendering engine must be expressed unambiguously for each concrete implementation of a Style in order to enable cartographic portrayal interoperability.
////

////
Can we omit this metadata? This might belon instead to the encoding or styles metadata.

| title      | Human readable title   | ParameterValue data type   | 0..1
| abstract   | Human readable description   | ParameterValue data type   | 0..1

| stylingRules | Styling rules defining the style   | StylingRule         | 0..*
|===

==== Styling Rules

A StylingRule specifies that a particular Symbolizer (defining how to portray data) should be applied if the rule is selected based on a Selector expression (e.g., feature-property conditions or map scales).
A StylingRule can contain nested rules, which will only be applied if the the parent rule's Selector is evaluated to true, and whose Symbolizers will inherit from and override the parent StylingRule's Symbolizer.

////
Do we need these? Should the style metadata be included in Core requirements class?

| title   | Human readable title   | ParameterValue data type   | One
| abstract   | Human readable description   | ParameterValue data type   | Zero or one
////


// Should defaults be defined in the conceptual / logical model, or specific to encodings?

////

Internationalization support would be great.
Where exactly do we need this?
The following was in ParameterValue, but most parameter values will be numbers/colors, or feature/covergge properties.
What actually needs i18n? Rule labels for legends? The choice between feature properties available in different languages?

| language   | Language identifier for the ParameterValue element. (a)   | Character String. This language identifier shall be as specified in IETF RFC 4646.   | zero or more
(a) The language identifier should offer a way to adapt the ParameterValue to a specified language, e.g., display the title of a Rule element both in English and French.

| name         | A name for the rule (useful for generating legends)             | string                   | 0..1

| nestedRules  | Additional styling rules to consider if this rule is selected partially overriding this rule's symbolizer | StylingRule              | 0..*
|===

The selector (also sometimes called a _filter_), for the rule is defined as a predicate expression evaluating to either true or false.

==== Symbolizers

A Symbolizer describes how to portray geographic data (e.g., vector features or gridded coverage data) based on a set of properties.
This core requirements class only defines three basic properties relevant to most portrayal use cases.
Separate requirements classes and later parts will extend this Symbolizer class with additional properties to provide more advanced portrayal capabilities.

// TODO: Illustrate above example with picture

////
-- I don't think we need the following explanation anymore:

To understand what the symbolizer concept is, consider a “Lake” feature type represented by a Polygon that is to be symbolized as a “blue” filled polygon with its boundary drawn with a “black” stroke.
As symbolizer is an abstract class: a concrete extension called here, for example, AreaSymbolizer, which must be provided to render an interior “fill” and an outlining “stroke.”
Consequently, the AreaSymbolizer extension will implement concrete extensions of the abstract Stroke and Fill classes of the conceptual model.

Depending on the type of geographical object, a set of symbolizer extensions can be conceived. For example a LineSymbolizer to draw a river, a PointSymbolizer to represent the “Hospitals,” or a
LabelSymbolizer to render the road name along a line.
////

==== Expressions

Expressions are a syntactic entity that may be evaluated to determine its value (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)[Wikipedia]).
The concept has similar meaning to Expressions as defined in the OGC Filter Encoding 2.0 standard, and can also be implemented with the OGC Common Query Language (CQL2),
with the caveat that the Expressions defined here are not restricted to evaluate to a boolean value as is the case for the first version of CQL2.

Expressions can be used in two places according to this Styles & Symbology conceptual model: as a Selector defining the condition whether to apply a StylingRule or not, as well
as to define the values of Symbolizer properties.

===== Parameter Values

The use of an expression as a Symbolizer property is called a _Parameter Value_, where an Expression can be substituted
where a particular data type is expected, in which case the Expression will be resolved to that expected data type.
Conceptually, all Symbolizer properties can be specified using any type of expression _Parameter Value_, but this is not required by
this core conformance class, and specific requirements classes such as the "Symbolizer Parameter Value Expresssions"
requirements class enable this behavior. Without a requirements class specifying otherwise, only <<literal-expressions,Literal Expressions>>
compatible with the expected data type are allowed as _Parameter Values_.

===== Identifier Expressions

An Identifier Expression is represented by a textual property that gets resolved at runtime.

Typical example of identifier expressions include feature properties (e.g., `population`) and coverage range values (e.g., a particular imagery band `B8`).

One specific type of identifier expressions use System Identifiers.
A System Identifier refers to an internal state of the system, or a particular aspect of the data being portrayed.

The following System Identifiers are defined by this conformance class:

**Visualization Rendering Passes**

Setting up symbolization rules for a selector on a visualization pass allows to render all data of
the map using different set of symbolizers.
A later pass will only begin after all data layers and their features / coverage cells have been rendered
with the symbolizers set for earlier visualization passes.

See also the _feature pass_ introduced in
<<rc-vector, Basic Vector Styling>> requirements class, which allows to render the same feature multiple times
with different symbolizers before rendering the next feature.

A literal expression is an expression that has a fixed value in the encoding of the style.
A similar literal class concept was originally defined in the OGC Filter Encoding 2.0 standard section 7.5.1.

The following types of literals are defined:

* An integer literal represents a whole numeric value (CCSSS example: `123`)
* A real literal represents a real number (integer, fractional or irrational number) (CCSSS example: `0.85`)
* Text literals are Unicode character strings (CCSSS example: `'København'`)
* A null literal represents an unset value (CCSSS example: `null`)
* Enumeration value literals allow to refer by name to a set of pre-defined values associated with the context where they are used (CCSSS example: `vector`)
* Boolean literals are a specialized type of enumeration literals which are either true or false (CCSSS example: `false`)
* Array literals (see <<array-expressions,Array Expressions>>) (CCSSS example: `(1, 2, 3)`)
* Instance literals (see <<instance-expressions,Instance Expressions>>) (CCSSS examples: `Color(20, 100, 80)` or `Color(r: 20, g: 100, b: 80)`)

===== Operation Expressions

An Operation Expression performs an operation specified by an Operator on one, two or three operand expressions, depending on whether they unary, binary or ternary operators.
This core requirements class defines only Logical and Relational operators.
Implementations are also required to support prioritizing operations (typically encoded using parentheses: `(` `)`).
Other requirements classes introduce support for additional operators for arithmetic, text and bitwise operations.
Without support for the _Any right-hand operand_ requirements class, the right-hand operands of RelationExpressions are limited to LiteralExpressions.

[[array-expressions]]
===== Array Expressions

An array expressions defines zero, one, or more element expressions forming an ordered set.

CCSSS example: `(123.0, viz.sd)`.

An _array literal_ is a special type of array expression whose elements are all literals.

[[instance-expressions]]
===== Instance Expressions

An instance expressions instantiates an object of a class while optionally specifying values for member components.
The default values for any member if not explicitly overridden can is specified by the class member definitions.

CCSSS examples:

* `DateTime(year: 2022, month: april, day: 6)`
* `Color(r: 20, g: 100, b: 80)`)

// We should probably consider including operators for accessing instance members, and indexing array elements.
// As new requirements classes ?

An _instance literal_ is a special type of instance expression assigning only literal expressions to its member components.

A Symbolizer may either set an object property with a complete new instance, or specifically override a particular member of that object property.
This capability is particularly useful when using nested StylingRules, where a nested rule can inherit the Symbolizer from the parent StylingRule.
